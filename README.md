# DisInfoVis

This is a repository for all outputs from the DisInfoVis project.

This is where I will write a summary of the Stipend, and what I managed to do with it.

In 2019, during my [MSc in Data Science at City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate/data-science-msc), I was awarded a [Data Science Institute](https://www.city-data-science-institute.com) _Project Stipend_ to complete my dissertation and engage in science communication initiatives around my research. My dissertation researched best practices for visualizing temporal networks of disinformation operations, and was supervised by [Professor Jason Dykes](https://www.gicentre.net/jsndyks/). 

Thanks to the Stipend, I was able to complete my dissertation, present it as a [Poster at EuroVis 2020](https://weber.itn.liu.se/~marfa45/egev2020/postersevent.html), and publish a [Medium article about my research process](link...).

Thanks to opportunities granted by the Stipend and by City, I moved on to complete a research project with the Mozilla Foundation which furthered my inquiries into visualisation practices, networks, and disinformation, and publish [an article that currently has over 95,000 views on Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/watch-six-decade-long-disinformation-operations-unfold-in-six-minutes-5f69a7e75fb3).

### Further details


- I have published a [Medium article](link...) about my research process, outlining my methods, findings, and learnings from my time at City and with Professor Dykes
- Jason and I co-authored a [poster about this project titled DisInfoVis at EuroVis 2020](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/eurp20201118), a major visualisation conference. At the virtual conference, I participated in the poster presentations and engaged in critical discussions about my design choices, and further opportunities for temporal network visualisation research
- All supplementary materials from the DisInfoVis project are on the [giCentre website](https://www.gicentre.net/disinfovis).
- After the completion of the Stipend, I went on to conduct a research project for the Mozilla Foundation and published the findings on Medium: [Watch six decade-long disinformation operations unfold in six minutes](https://medium.com/swlh/watch-six-decade-long-disinformation-operations-unfold-in-six-minutes-5f69a7e75fb3). This project built on the design learnings from the DisInfoVis project, and the article has 95,000+ views on Medium.
