# DisInfoVis
This is a repository for all outputs from the DisInfoVis project.

This is where I will write a summary of the Stipend, and what I managed to do with it.

In 2019, during my MSc in Data Science at City, University of London, I was granted a Data Science Institute Project Stipend to complete my dissertation and engage in science communication innitiatives around my research. My dissertation researched best practices for visualizing temporal networks of disinformation operations, and was supervised by Professor Jason Dykes. 

Thanks to the Stipend, I was able to complete my dissertation, present it as a poster at EuroVis 2020, and publish a Medium article about my research process. Thanks to opportunities granted by the Stipend and by City, I moved on to complete a research project with the Mozilla Foundation which furthered my inquiries into visualisation practices, networks, and disinformation, and publish an article that currently has over 95,000 views on Medium.

# Further details on outputs from the Data Science Institute Project Stipend


- I have published a [Medium article](link...) about my research process, outlining my methods, findings, and learnings from my time at City and with Professor Dykes
- Jason and I co-authored a [poster about this project titled DisInfoVis at EuroVis 2020](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/eurp20201118), a major visualisation conference. At the virtual conference, I participated in the poster presentations and engaged in critical discussions about my design choices, and further opportunities for temporal network visualisation research
- All suplementary materials from the DisInfoVis project are on the[giCentre website](https://www.gicentre.net/disinfovis).
- After th ecompletion of the Stipend, I went on to conduct a research project for the Mozilla Foundation and published the findings on Medium:[Watch six decade-long disinformation operations unfold in six minutes](https://medium.com/swlh/watch-six-decade-long-disinformation-operations-unfold-in-six-minutes-5f69a7e75fb3). This project built on the design learnings from the DisInfoVis project, and the article has 95,000+ views on Medium.
